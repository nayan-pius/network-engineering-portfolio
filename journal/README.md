# 📓 Engineering Logbook
**Author:** Pius Nayan
**Status:** Active Learning

This directory serves as the central archive for my daily learning notes. While the `labs` folder contains the *technical* work, this journal documents the *mental* work: the concepts, the troubleshooting process, and the "Aha!" moments.
