# 📓 Engineering Logbook
**Author:** Pius Nayan

A daily record of concepts learned, challenges faced, and "Aha!" moments. This logbook tracks the *process* of learning, not just the final result.

## 🔍 Why this exists
Great engineering is about troubleshooting and iteration. This journal documents the *why* and *how* behind the technical decisions in the labs.

### 📅 Day 2: The Switch "Brain" (Feb 3, 2026)
**Time Spent:** 1.5 Hours

**What I Did:**
- Transitioned from connecting two computers to building a real LAN with a Cisco 2960 Switch
- Learned CLI (Command Line Interface) fundamentals using `enable` and `show mac address-table` commands

**Key Insight:**
- The MAC Address table population was revealing—the switch dynamically learns device locations. It starts empty, then remembers which MAC addresses map to which ports as devices communicate. The network became tangible in that moment.

**Challenges Encountered:**
- Resolved Git connectivity issues by troubleshooting browser connectivity and pinging external servers

**Next Steps:**
- Explore VLAN (Virtual LAN) configuration or introduction to Routers
