### 📅 Day 2: The Switch "Brain" (Feb 3, 2026)
**Time Spent:** 1.5 Hours

**What I Did:**
- Moved from connecting two computers to building a real LAN with a Cisco 2960 Switch
- Learned CLI (Command Line Interface) fundamentals using `enable` and `show mac address-table` commands

**Key Insight:**
- The MAC Address table population was revealing—the switch dynamically learns device locations. It starts empty, then remembers which MAC addresses map to which ports as devices communicate. The network became tangible in that moment.

**Challenges Encountered:**
- Git connectivity issues resolved by troubleshooting browser connectivity and pinging external servers

**Next Steps:**
- Explore VLAN (Virtual LAN) configuration or introduction to Routers
