## 📅 Day 01: The First Connection (Physical Layer)
**Date:** February 2, 2026
**Focus:** Layer 1 Cabling, Git Setup, Peer-to-Peer

### 📝 Summary
The start of the journey. I established a direct Peer-to-Peer connection between two PCs and set up the professional development environment (VS Code + Git).

### 💡 Key Learnings
* **Cabling Rules:**
  * **Crossover Cable:** Used for connecting *same* devices (PC to PC).
  * **Straight-Through:** Used for *different* devices (PC to Switch).
* **Git Workflow:** Learned the "Save & Send" rhythm: `git add .` -> `git commit` -> `git push`.
* **The Empty Folder Trap:** Git ignores empty folders. I had to create `README.md` placeholder files to make my folder structure appear on GitHub.
